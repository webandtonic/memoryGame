web&tonic Memory Game - Readme.text

-----------------------------------------------------------

Play the well-known game "Memory" in the web&tonic style:

There are 8x 2 cards with the same picture on them. Your task is to find the matching pairs.

Click on a card to open it. When you have opened two cards and they match, they will stay open. If they do not match, both cards will close and you can try again.

Your performance is rated with a five-star-system, counting your moves. Each click on a card is a move. The rating works as follows:

24 moves or less: 5 stars
up to 36 moves: 4 stars
up to 48 moves: 3 stars
up to 60 moves: 2 stars
up to 72 moves: 1 star
more than 72 stars: 0 stars

The time you need is also being stopped. It has however no impact on your rating.

You have won the game, when you have found all card pairs.

Enjoy!
